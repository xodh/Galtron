# Galtron
A simple 2D shooter made with pygame, written in python...

Props to Python Crash Course for the awesome tut. Although i did add a little extra, was more of just a learning curve sort of thing and to learn more about python. Input welcome by anyone.

To run the game:
	-Needs python2.7 and pygame
	-Open a terminal and cd to Galtron
	-Enter python main.py
